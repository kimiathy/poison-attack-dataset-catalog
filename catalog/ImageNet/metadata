Dataset Name: ImageNet

Description: ImageNet is a large-scale and highly-diversified dataset for object detection and image classification tasks. It contains over 14 million images belonging to over 20,000 classes. The images were collected from the internet and labeled by human labelers using Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing tool.

Size: The complete ImageNet dataset is over 150 GB.

Number of Classes: 20,000 classes

Number of Samples: 14 million images

Data Type: Images

Data Format: Typically JPEG, but it depends on the specific subset of the data

Preprocessing Requirements: Preprocessing usually involves resizing the images to the required dimensions, normalizing the pixel values, and sometimes augmenting the data through techniques like rotation, translation, zoom, flips, etc.
