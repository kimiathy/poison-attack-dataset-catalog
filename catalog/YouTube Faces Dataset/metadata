Dataset Name: YouTube Faces Dataset

Description: The YouTube Faces Database is a dataset consisting of 3,425 videos of 1,595 different people obtained from YouTube. All the videos contain a single individual, are frontal or near frontal, with good quality resolution and are between 48 and 6,070 frames in length.

Size: Approximately 186 GB

Number of Classes: There are 1,595 different people in the database, so we can consider these as the classes.

Number of Samples: The dataset consists of 3,425 videos.

Data Type: Video (Faces)

Data Format: The data is provided in .avi video format. Each video is a separate file.

Preprocessing Requirements: Preprocessing depends on the use case, but common tasks include face detection, alignment, and normalization. For some tasks, you might want to extract frames and convert them into image files.
