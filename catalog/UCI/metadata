Dataset Name: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description: The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms. The datasets cover a broad range of applications, and include binary/multiclass classification problems, regression problems, and unsupervised learning tasks.

Size: The size varies greatly per dataset (For example: the "Adult" dataset is about 3.8 MB, while the "YouTube Comedy Slam Preference Data" is approximately 12 GB)

Number of Classes: This varies per dataset (for example: The Iris dataset, a classic in machine learning, has 3 classes, while the Covertype dataset has 7 classes)

Number of Samples: This varies per dataset (for example: The Wine dataset has 178 instances, while the "Individual household electric power consumption" dataset has over 2 million instances)

Data Type: contains datasets with numeric, categorical, text, image, and other types of data

Data Format: CSV, ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format), etc

Preprocessing Requirements: Many datasets are preprocessed
