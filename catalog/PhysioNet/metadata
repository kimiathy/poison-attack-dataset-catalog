Dataset Name: PhysioNet

Full Description: PhysioNet offers free web access to large collections of recorded physiologic signals and related open-source software. The data are organized into collections, e.g., by disease (sleep disorders, cardiac disorders), signal type (ECG, EEG, multiparameter), and challenge (competition tasks).

Size: The size varies per dataset

Number of Classes: depends on the specific dataset

Number of Samples: depends on the specific dataset

Data Type: physiological signals (e.g., ECG, EEG, PPG), clinical data, imaging data

Data Format: waveform-database (WFDB) format, a set of digital formats for time-series data, particularly digitized waveforms

Preprocessing Requirements: Preprocessing needs can vary widely depending on the use case. Some possible preprocessing steps include signal noise reduction, feature extraction, segmentation, and normalization.
