Dataset Name: TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus

Description: TIMIT is an acoustic-phonetic continuous speech corpus produced by Texas Instruments and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (hence the acronym TIMIT). It contains a total of 6300 sentences, 10 sentences spoken by each of 630 speakers from 8 major dialect regions of the United States. The phonetically transcribed speech is designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems.

Size: 440 MB

Number of Classes: This dataset doesn't have classes in the traditional sense, but includes speech from speakers from 8 major dialect regions

Number of Samples: 6300 sentences

Data Type: Audio

Data Format: NIST SPHERE file format

Preprocessing Requirements: Audio signal processing might be required which could include features extraction like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma Features, Spectral Contrast, Tonnetz etc. Transcription data may need parsing and tokenizing.

Original Paper: The dataset is a product of several studies and does not have a single definitive paper.

Source Link: The dataset is not freely available.
