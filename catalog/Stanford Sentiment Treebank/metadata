Dataset Name: Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)

Description: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is an extension of the Movie Review data by Pang and Lee (2005). The dataset includes sentences parsed into syntactic trees, which allows for a complete analysis of sentiment analysis on trees. It contains 215,154 phrases from 11,855 sentences of movie reviews.

Size: small dataset as it consists of text data from movie reviews

Number of Classes: contains phrases that are rated on a scale from 0 to 1 (very negative to very positive) that can be interpreted as 5 classes (0-0.2: very negative, 0.2-0.4: somewhat negative, 0.4-0.6: neutral, 0.6-0.8: somewhat positive, 0.8-1: very positive)

Number of Samples: 215,154 phrases from 11,855 sentences

Data Type: Text

Data Format: CSV file with each line representing a phrase and its corresponding sentiment

Preprocessing Requirements: Text data may require cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization (e.g., word embeddings, TF-IDF) before being fed into a model.
