Dataset Name: KDD Cup 1999 Data

Full Description: The KDD Cup 1999 dataset is derived from the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program by MIT Lincoln Lab in 1998. The dataset contains a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. The dataset is designed for testing network intrusion detection systems and has been widely used for building machine learning models for cybersecurity.

Size in MB: 740 MB

Number of Classes: 23 classes of attacks, grouped into four main categories: DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R, along with the 'Normal' category for non-attack network traffic

Number of Samples: 5 million connection records.

Data Type: contains both categorical and numerical data

Data Format: CSV format

Complete Preprocessing Requirements: Data cleaning may be necessary as the dataset contains redundant and irrelevant records. Depending on the model, additional preprocessing might include normalization of the numerical features, encoding of categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
