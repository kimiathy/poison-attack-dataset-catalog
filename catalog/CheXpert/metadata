Dataset Name: CheXpert

Description: CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and competition for automated chest x-ray interpretation, which features uncertainty labels and radiologist-labeled reference standard evaluation sets. It consists of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or uncertain.

Size: 439 GB

Number of Classes: 14 observations/pathologies

Number of Samples: 224,316 chest X-rays

Data Type: Primarily image data (chest X-rays)

Data Format: DICOM format

Preprocessing Requirements: Images might need to be preprocessed depending on the model being used, such as resizing, normalization, handling uncertain labels, etc.
