Dataset Name: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

Description: The MNIST dataset is a large dataset of handwritten digits widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. 
It contains a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

Size: 53 MB (uncompressed)

Number of Classes: 10 classes, each representing one digit (0-9)

Number of Samples: contains a total of 70,000 samples, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images

Data Type: grayscale images

Data Format: binary format, with separate files for training and testing sets. Each image is 28 x 28 pixels

Preprocessing Requirements: The data is already preprocessed and ready to use. Each image is size-normalized and centered. 
However, we might need to normalize the pixel values (range 0-255) to a range between 0 and 1 depending on the requirements of our specific machine learning model.
